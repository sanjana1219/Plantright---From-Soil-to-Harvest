# Plantright-From Soil to Harvest
Crop Recommendation System using Data Mining

Project Overview
Plantright is a data-driven crop recommendation system developed to support smarter agricultural decision-making. The project uses data mining techniques to predict the most suitable crops based on soil composition and environmental conditions such as nutrient levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

The system applies the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm to analyze agricultural data and generate accurate crop recommendations. By combining statistical analysis and machine learning, this project helps farmers improve productivity, optimize resources, and promote sustainable farming practices.


Objectives of the Project


•	Predict the most suitable crop based on soil and climate conditions

•	Apply data mining techniques in agriculture

•	Improve decision-making using data-driven insights

•	Promote sustainable and efficient farming practices


📂 Dataset Selection

The dataset used in this project is the Crop Recommendation Dataset, developed by the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture (ICFA).
It contains 2,200 crop samples with seven independent variables and one target variable.


Dataset Features


•	Nitrogen (N) — Soil nutrient level

•	Phosphorus (P) — Root development factor

•	Potassium (K) — Plant health indicator

•	Temperature (°C) — Climate condition

•	Humidity (%) — Environmental moisture level

•	pH — Soil acidity/alkalinity

•	Rainfall (mm) — Water availability

The target variable represents the recommended crop type.


Why This Dataset Was Selected


•	Contains real agricultural data

•	Includes key soil and climate factors

•	Suitable for classification analysis



Technologies Used


•	R Programming

•	Data Mining Techniques

•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

Data Visualization Tools

•	Data Mining Techniques Applied
•	Classification — KNN Algorithm

The project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify crops based on similarity to existing data points.


Key steps:


•	Data preprocessing and normalization

•	Training and testing data split (70% / 30%)

•	Optimal K-value selection using error analysis

•	Model evaluation using confusion matrix


Impact of the Project


This system can support:

•	Better crop selection decisions

•	Efficient resource allocation

•	Reduced fertilizer and water wastage

•	Climate-adaptive farming practices

•	Sustainable agricultural development
